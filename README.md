# SliceLocator
A ReactNative app that locates events with free food at Lafayette College (built using React and NativeBase)

The app schedules and sends notifications to the user 15 minutes before each Lafayette College event that has free pizza/snacks provided.

The event list is automatically updated twice a day through a parser script that looks at the college calendar and filters events based on their description, trying to find keywords such as "lunch provided", "pizza" and "snacks".
